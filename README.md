# YouTube Clone - A Portfolio Piece

## WIP

I'm building this app because most of the projects I work on have proprietary codebases; it's difficult to demonstrate commercial ability at a glance when this is the case.

The whole app is being built from scratch. OOP has been used on the backend because I'm an OO guy at heart, it doesn't really have a place in frontend work though.

This is the client-side of the project - please see TODO_INSERT_SERVER_REPO_LINK to view the server-side.

Core tech:

- ReactJS w/ TypeScript
- Zustand for state management
